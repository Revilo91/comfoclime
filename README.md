HomeAssistant integration of Zehnder ComfoClime (and all devices in ComfoNet bus like the ComfoAir Q) 

## Features
ComfoClime is a HVAC solution as additional device for the ComfoAir Q series. It comes with its own app and an propietary JSON API. The ComfoClime unit is connected to the local network via WiFi/WLAN, the API is available only local via HTTP requests without authentication. The integration can also control the ventilation main unit ComfoAir Q. It currently offers:

* reading the dashboard data similar to the official app (sensors)
* writing the active temperature profile (select)
* setting the ventilation fan speed (fan)
* reading and writing the thermalprofile (sensors, selects and numbers)
* reading additional telemetry values of *all* connected devices (sensors; known already from ComfoConnect integration)
* arranging telemetry and property values into different devices
* reading additional property values of *all* connected devices (sensors)
* writing additional property values of *all* connected devices (service, numbers)
* restarting the ComfoClime unit via service call
* configuration via config flow by host/ip
* locals in english and german

## API Documentation

A comprehensive API documentation is available:

* **German**: [ComfoClimeAPI.md](ComfoClimeAPI.md) - Vollst√§ndige deutsche API-Dokumentation mit allen Endpunkten, Parametern und Beispielen
* **English**: [Original API documentation](https://github.com/msfuture/comfoclime_api/blob/main/ComfoClimeAPI.md) - Original reverse engineered API knowledge

Feel free to extend!

## Installation

* add this repository via HACS (user defined repositories, URL: `https://github.com/msfuture/comfoclime`)
* install the "Zehnder ComfoClime" integration in HACS
* restart Home Assistant
* add the ComfoClime device (connected devices like the ComfoAir Q are detected and added automatically)

## Current ToDo / development
There are many more telemetry and property values, that make sense to be offered by the integration. The ComfoClime unit itself is fully integrated but there are some missing sensors, switches and numbers of the ComfoAirQ unit to be added in the future. You are missing one? The definitions are in seperate files in the entities folder, so you can try them yourself. If they are working you can open an issue or directly open a pull request.

Also I appreciate any suggestions or pull requests that clean up my messy code üòä

Feel free to participate! üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Thanks to...

@michaelarnauts and his integration of ComfoConnect, where I discovered a lot of telemetries and properties of the ventilation unit:
