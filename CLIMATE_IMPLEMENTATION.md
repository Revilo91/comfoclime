# ComfoClime Climate Entity Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented a comprehensive climate control entity for the ComfoClime Home Assistant integration. The climate entity provides unified control over the heating, cooling, and ventilation system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Climate Entity (`climate.py`)
- **HVAC Modes**: OFF, HEAT, COOL, FAN_ONLY
- **Preset Modes**: comfort, power, eco
- **Temperature Control**: Target temperature setting with season-aware ranges
- **Current Temperature**: Display from indoor sensor
- **HVAC Action Detection**: Shows current system activity (heating/cooling/fan/idle)

### 2. Season-Aware Operation
- Automatic detection of heating/cooling/transition seasons
- Temperature ranges adjust automatically:
  - Heating: 15-25°C
  - Cooling: 20-28°C
- HVAC modes automatically set appropriate season

### 3. Integration with Existing API
- Uses existing `ComfoClimeAPI` methods
- Integrates with dashboard and thermal profile coordinators
- Maintains compatibility with existing sensors and controls

### 4. Translations
- German translations in `de.json`
- English translations in `en.json`
- Climate-specific preset mode translations

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `custom_components/comfoclime/climate.py` - Main climate entity implementation

### Modified Files
- `custom_components/comfoclime/__init__.py` - Added climate platform to setup
- `custom_components/comfoclime/translations/de.json` - German climate translations
- `custom_components/comfoclime/translations/en.json` - English climate translations
- `README.md` - Updated documentation with climate features

## API Methods Used

### Reading Data
- `coordinator.data` - Dashboard data (current temperature, fan speed, season)
- `_thermalprofile_coordinator.data` - Thermal profile data (target temperatures)

### Writing Data
- `_api.update_thermal_profile(updates)` - Set target temperatures and seasons
- `_api.set_device_setting(temperature_profile, fan_speed)` - Set preset modes and fan control

## HVAC Mode Logic

| Season | Fan Active | HVAC Mode |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| heating | True | HEAT |
| cooling | True | COOL |
| transition | True | FAN_ONLY |
| Any | False | OFF |

## Temperature Profile Mapping

| Preset | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| comfort | 0 | Maximum comfort |
| power | 1 | Power mode |
| eco | 2 | Energy efficient |

## Installation Instructions

1. Copy the entire `custom_components/comfoclime/` folder to your Home Assistant custom components directory
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Add the ComfoClime integration via Configuration > Integrations
4. The climate entity will appear as "ComfoClime Climate"

## Usage in Home Assistant

The climate entity provides:
- Thermostat card in Lovelace UI
- Service calls for automation
- Climate control in Home Assistant app
- Voice control compatibility (Alexa, Google Assistant)

## Technical Notes

- Climate entity follows Home Assistant climate platform standards
- Proper error handling with exception logging
- Coordinator-based state management for efficiency
- Async/await pattern throughout
- Type hints for better IDE support

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Fan speed control integration
- Humidity control
- Advanced scheduling
- More preset modes
- Energy usage tracking

The implementation is production-ready and fully compatible with Home Assistant's climate platform requirements.
